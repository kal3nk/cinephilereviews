        <p>
          Se7en by David Fincher is a intriguing detective-drama with some very
          dark and haunting visuals.<br />
          <br />
          This film is definitely not my favorite Fincher film, as Fight Club
          still holds that special place in my heart. It doesn't really hold up,
          but then again, I think that film is a masterpiece, so I'm going to
          judge this film as I would any other film without any previous biases.
          Well, I'll try at least.<br />
          <br />
          Se7en is a very fun film, every single scene leaves you wanting more
          and more. Every single crime scene we encounter is just so incredibly
          gruesome, it shows how absolutely sick the individual who is behind
          this is. The integration of the devilish imagery, with the inclusion
          of the seven deadly sins, was flawless. It makes the serial killer
          seem sane, he knows what he's doing and he genuinely believes in what
          he is preaching. It makes him just so much more frightening.<br />
          <br />
          The film is also just visually stunning, not just Brad Pitt, but the
          film just looks incredibly good. The set design and the practical
          effects are so incredibly gritty. It makes the setting believable to
          the point where I believe that the city they are in is as bad as it is
          portrayed as. It's gross, filthy and depressing.<br />
          <br />
          In conclusion, it's a great film with some amazing elements.
