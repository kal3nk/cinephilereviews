        <p>Se7en by David Fincher is a intriguing detective-drama with some very dark and haunting visuals.</p>
        <p>This film is definitely not my favorite Fincher film, as Fight Club still holds that special place in my heart. It doesn't really hold up, but then again, I think that film is a masterpiece, so I'm going to judge this film as I would any other film without any previous biases. Well, I'll try at least.</p>
        <p>Se7en is a very fun film, every single scene leaves you wanting more and more. Every single crime scene we encounter is just so incredibly gruesome, it shows how absolutely sick the individual who is behind this is. The integration of the devilish imagery, with the inclusion of the seven deadly sins, was flawless. It makes the serial killer seem sane, he knows what he's doing and he genuinely believes in what he is preaching. It makes him just so much more frightening.</p>
        <p>The film is also just visually stunning, not just Brad Pitt, but the film just looks incredibly good. The set design and the practical effects are so incredibly gritty. It makes the setting believable to the point where I believe that the city they are in is as bad as it is portrayed as. It's gross, filthy and depressing.</p>
        <p>In conclusion, it's a great film with some amazing elements.</p>
