          <p>
            Hi, I'm Seth also known as
            <a href="https://letterboxd.com/Taiyoboi/">Taiyo</a> on my
            Letterboxd. I'm a 20-year-old Communication and Multimedia Design
            student at the Amsterdam University of Applied Sciences (AUAS).
          </p>
          <p>
            Next to that I spend most of my time watching films, that's why I
            made this website, as I feel limited by Letterboxd's features. On
            this website I cross reference my reviews, but also add some
            features that I can't on my Letterboxd. Things like The Top 3 of the
            Month and this about me page.

          <h2>My Favorite Directors of All Time</h2>
          <p>
            Next to enjoying individual films, I also have some favorite
            directors. My favorite directors include names like;
          </p>
          <p>
            <strong>Edgar Wright</strong>: An English director with a very
            distinct style that prioritizes an interaction between the visuals
            and the audio.
          </p>
          <p>
            <strong>Park Chan-wook</strong>: A South-Korean director that is a
            better version of Quentin Tarantino, and then some. He is also my
            favorite director of all time.
          </p>
          <p>
            <strong>Hirokazu Kore-eda</strong>: A Japanese director that is
            known for his found-family stories that make you feel something like
            never before.
