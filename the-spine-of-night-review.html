              The Spine of Night by Philip Gelatt & Morgan Galen King was
              everything I could ever want, but yet I was still disappointed.
            </p>
            <p>
              This film is supposed to be a love-letter to Ralph Bakshi, using
              rotoscope animation techniques. It's a dark fantasy filled with
              gore and nudity. It seems right up my alley, an honest tale in a
              world that I can explore, yet it still wasn't what I wanted.
            </p>
            <p>
              The execution is just so lacking. I genuinely don't know what went
              wrong. There were amazing people across the board working on this
              film, yet it still wasn't as good as I expected it would be. The
              script is very lack-luster, the dialogue feels unnatural in the
              way it's written. Characters that get introduced just get
              abandoned the second after they've had their 10 minutes of fame.
              The world has beautiful pieces when it comes to the animation, but
              nothing gets explained, nothing reaches the magical feeling I want
              in a film like this.
            </p>
            <p>
              Not only did the script and plot bother me a lot, the voice acting
              of the main villain, Ghal Sur, which is supposed to be a scary and
              disturbing character sounds absolutely awful. The way Jordan
              Douglas Smith delivered his lines and the way his voice sounded
              just doesn't match up with his character was even laughable to
              some extent. Especially his evil laugh sounds like it could've
              been delivered by a literal child which favorite anime is Dragon
              Ball Z. Most of the voice acting felt like it was meant more as a
              comedy for Adult Swim, then a very dark and grim fantasy. Why is
              Patton Oswalt here?
            </p>
            <p>
              The animation throughout is quite beautiful, I can't disagree with
              that. However I do have some nitpicks, why weren't there any
              shadows in the characters' animation while the backgrounds were
              incredibly detailed. Why were there still lipflaps after the
              characters were done talking. The action sequences also felt very
              slow and clunky. It's just small details, but as an entire
              experience it still bothers me a lot.
            </p>
            <p>
              Of course there are some very memorable things about this film,
              like the soundtrack and the sounddesign, which makes it a much
              more immersive experience. Other things I liked was the origin of
              the gods, which was a beautifully animated sequence, this was the
              actual first time I felt pulled into the film's universe. The
              ending of the film was also very strong, with a very great final
              battle between Ghal Sur. Still, both of these things still don't
              save this film and I'm quite disappointed as I was very, very
              hyped for this film.
            </p>
            <p>
              However, hopefully these two do go on to make more films like
              this, as I feel like we need more like, but just of better
              quality. I will be watching out for their next feature.
