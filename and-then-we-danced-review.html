          And Then We Danced by Levan Akin made me sob my fucking eyes out. This
          film is not incredibly well-shot. The film itself doesn't look
          amazing. But why? Why do I feel like this? How is it able to make me
          feel so much?<br />
          <br />
          The amount of emotion I felt during this film is still inconceivable
          to me. I felt all of them. Anger. Sadness. Jealousy. Happiness. Love.
          Joy. All of the aforementioned emotions went through my head. Yet, I
          still can't put into words how much of it I've felt.<br />
          <br />
          I'm getting a little to ahead of myself though. I haven't even talked
          about the film itself yet. The story follows a young Georgian dancer,
          Merab, that wants to get into the main ensemble of a certain dance
          company. Then we get introduced to Irakli, a new dancer who becomes
          his rival, but also his strongest yearning.<br />
          <br />
          This film completely encapsulates you with its story. The story of
          this young man finding out where his sexuality lies and how to embrace
          his own identity. It tells the story with the highest amount of
          purity. It's so genuine, it's so real. The subtleties of emotion you
          see in the face Merab are astonishing and it perfectly portrays the
          early stages of love and how it develops later on.<br />
          <br />
          Not only does it show love's purity, but it also shows platonic
          relationships that just makes me want to cry. It's so wholesome. It's
          so nice. Yet, there is one scene that takes the cake. The scene where
          hesitance and acceptance are set in the foreground of the film. This
          scene made me sob. I couldn't stop crying. Even now, while thinking
          and writing about it, I'm crying again.<br />
          <br />
          The performances by Levan Gelbakhiani and Bachi Valishvili are so
          genuine. The story they tell through their dialogue, their bodies and
          their faces feel so real. It almost feels like I'm following them via
          a documentary crew, not even a film.<br />
          <br />
          Yet, all of these emotions wouldn't have been possible without the
          accompanying score and the choreography. They make this film what it
          is and as the base of the story, it really does an amazing job. I'm so
          incredibly impressed.<br />
          <br />
          In conclusion this is my favorite film. It's a film that tells its
          story not only through dialogue, but also through choreography, music
          and just pure human emotion.<br />
